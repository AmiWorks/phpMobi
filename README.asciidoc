phpMobi file generator
======================

phpMobi is a tool that can generate .mobi files from a valid html file
written in php. While this was more meant as an experiment, this tool
works quite well and can be used to generate mobipocket files from most
websites.

MobiPocket is an eBook format created by Mobipocket SA. This tool also
uses a php readability port made by

Code example
------------

See index.php for an example (loads up a local html file). The following
code is used:

**********
$options = array(
	"title"=>"GROUP BY vs ORDER BY",
	"author"=>"thetricky.net",
	"subject"=>"MySql"
);

$mobi = new MOBI();
$mobi->setFileSource("test/test.html");
$mobi->setOptions($options);

$mobi->save("test/test.mobi");
**********

The options array contains the metadata (if possible, always specify
title, which is sometimes used as identifier in Mobi readers).

Implementation
--------------

This code was implemented while reverse-engineering the MobiPocket format.
Therefore this code absolutely isn't optimized for speed, but rather for
easy changes, as getting it to produce valid files was quite fiddly.
